- V 1.0.0.0: Added more data input options for .janno files (d(), da(), j(), .janno). Reorganized golden tests and added new ones. Switched to the PVP versioning scheme.
- V 1.0.1: Structural refactoring: To get a proper test coverage report it was necessary to split library, executable and test code. No user-facing changes in qjanno.
- V 1.0.0: Initial version: Fork of qsh with adjustments to directly incorporate .janno files.
